# RK_CRT
This directory contains R scripts for the analysis of conditionally rare taxa in 16S amplicon data. This code was used for analyses done in chapter 6 of my thesis and for Kaminsky and Morales, 2018 (under review). 

Identification of CRT was done using R scripts from Shade A, Jones SE, Caporaso JG, Handelsman J, Knight R, Fierer N, Gilbert JA. (2014). Conditionally rare taxa disproportionately contribute to changes in microbial diversity. MBio 5:e01371-14.
